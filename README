yarsa which do backups into datetime directory like:
rsb_YYMMGGhhmm

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

* The backup directory and the at least one backup sub-directory must
  exist. For the 1st backup do:
  mkdir -p <backup directory>/rsb_1

* The file yarsa_exclude.cfg with (eventually) the list of
  the file/directory to ignore, MUST exists in the backup directory.
  Create a void file if nothing has to be excluded.
  See rsync man's pages for more info.

* The source directory ending slash (/) is important,
  This /my/source -- goes to --> <backup directory>/AAMMGGhhmm/source
  This /my/source/ -- goes to --> <backup directory>/AAMMGGhhmm


Manual call example
-------------------
* backup the dir /home into the /mnt/usbdrive/backup-home
  keep 10 backups

# Initialize the backup directory and no file to be excluded.
mkdir -p /mnt/usbdrive/backup-home/rsb_1
touch /mnt/usbdrive/backup-home/yarsa_exclude.cfg

# Run the backup
yarsa /home /mnt/usbdrive/backup-home 10


* backup the host myserver.local rsyncd module users into the
  /mnt/myserver.local/users
  keep 5 backups, exclude all the Cache directory.

# Initialize the backup directory and configuration file.
mkdir -p /mnt/myserver.local/users/rsb_1
echo "Cache/" > /mnt/myserver.local/users/yarsa_exclude.cfg

# Run the backup
yarsa myserver.local::users /mnt/myserver.local/users 5


HOWTO test it
-------------
# Create the 1st fake directory
mkdir -p /tmp/test_backups/rsb_1

# Create the fake config file (void)
touch /tmp/test_backups/yarsa_exclude.cfg

# backup a real directory (ex. /home/myuser/backupme):
yarsa /home/myuser/backupme /tmp/test_backups 3

# Repeat the backup over and over playing with the config file and
# the number of backups.
