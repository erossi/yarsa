rsync_backup which do backups into datetime directory like:
 YYMMGGhhmm

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

* The file rsync_backup_exclude.cfg with (eventually) the list of
  the file/directory to ignore, MUST exists in the backup directory.

* The source directory ending slash (/) is important,
  This /my/source -- goes to --> /backup/to/AAMMGGhhmm/source
  This /my/source/ -- goes to --> /backup/to/AAMMGGhhmm


Manual call example
-------------------
# backup the dir /home into the /mnt/usbdrive/backup-home
# keep 10 backups
./rsync_backup /home /mnt/usbdrive/backup-home 10

# backup the host myserver.local rsyncd module users into the
# /mnt/usbdrive/backup-myserver.local/users
# keep 5 backups
./rsync_backup myserver.local::users /mnt/usbdrive/backup-myserver.local/users 5


HOWTO test it
-------------
# Create the 1st fake directory, does not work if at least 1 old
# directory is missing.
mkdir -p /tmp/test_backups/rsb_1

# Create the fake config file (void)
touch /tmp/test_backups/rsync_backup_exclude.cfg

# backup a real directory as a test like:
./rsync_backup /home/enrico/rsync_backup /tmp/test_backups 3

# Repeat the backup over and over playing with the config file and
# the number of backups.
